# Web Server -> phi-go

based on http://42skills.com/

Design and implement a lightweight web server that processes incoming network requests over HTTP protocol. Web server processes and delivers web pages to clients (usually, browsers). The pages are HTTP documents. While the primary function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting web forms, including uploading of files (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server). For an inspiration, try to imitate the Nginx web server.
