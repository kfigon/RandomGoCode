Exercise 1-10. Word count (linear time, no buffers)

Exercise 1-14. Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters in its input.
It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging.

Exercise 1-23. Write a program to remove all comments from a C program. Don’t forget to handle quoted strings and character constants properly. C comments do not nest.

Exercise 1-24. Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary syntax errors like unbalanced parentheses, brackets and braces. Don’t forget about quotes, both single and double, escape sequences, and comments. (This program is hard if you do it in full generality.)

Exercise 2-3. Write the function htoi(s), which converts a string of hexadecimal digits (including an optional 0x or 0X) into its equivalent integer value. The allowable digits are 0 through 9, a through f, and A through F.
